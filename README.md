# RHyd

This code was developed between 2013-2015, while I was working as student researcher at Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.
The topic of the research was investigating the time evolution of the Quark Gluon Plasma. 
The research was done by me (battila93@gmail.com) with help from my supervisor Mate Csanad (csanad@elte.hu).
